## univ3_pos_info

Easy way to get basi information from any Uniswap V3 position (open or close; on range or out of range).

Type the position ID in the `config_pos.yml` and run `__init__.py`.

#### WIP:
The info given for an out-of-range position is not accurate sometimes, but it might be a problem from TheGraph (tbc)
